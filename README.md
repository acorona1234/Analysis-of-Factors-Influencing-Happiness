## Introduction:

Welcome to this Python notebook on analyzing the World Happiness Report dataset. In this notebook, we will explore the factors that contribute to happiness across different countries. The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th anniversary, provides valuable insights into how people evaluate their own lives in over 150 countries worldwide.

The dataset we will be working with contains the Happiness Score for 146 countries, along with the factors used to explain the score. The scores are based on individuals' own assessments of their lives, as determined by their responses to the Cantril ladder life-evaluation question. This dataset also includes information on various variables such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perceptions of government/business corruption, and a hypothetical measure called Dystopia.

Before we delve into the analysis, let's briefly discuss how happiness levels are measured in this report. Key indicators such as health and wealth are measured using metrics like GDP per capita and life expectancy rates. Additionally, the report considers more intangible aspects by collecting survey responses to assess social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

The objective of this analysis is to identify the factors that contribute most significantly to happiness. Specifically, we will explore the relationship between the Happiness Score and variables such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices. By examining the statistical associations between these variables and the Happiness Score, we aim to determine their relative importance in influencing happiness levels across different countries.

Now, let's dive into the data and uncover the insights it holds!

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, this analysis aimed to identify the factors that contribute significantly to happiness across different countries using the World Happiness Report dataset. After conducting the analysis, we found that GDP per capita, followed by social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices, are the major contributors to happiness.

Our findings suggest that a country's economic prosperity, as measured by GDP per capita, has a strong positive correlation with happiness. Higher GDP per capita indicates increased access to resources and opportunities, which in turn contributes to overall life satisfaction.

Moreover, social support emerged as the second most influential factor. Countries with robust social support systems tend to have happier populations. Access to strong social networks, supportive relationships, and community connections positively impact individuals' well-being and contribute to their happiness.

Furthermore, healthy life expectancy was found to be another crucial factor affecting happiness. Countries with longer life expectancies and better healthcare systems tend to have higher levels of happiness among their residents.

Lastly, freedom to make life choices also showed a positive association with happiness. When individuals have the autonomy to make decisions about their own lives and have control over their actions, they are more likely to experience higher levels of happiness.

Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of economic prosperity, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom in determining happiness levels across countries. By understanding these factors, policymakers and societies can focus their efforts on creating environments that promote well-being and enhance the happiness of their citizens.
